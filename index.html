            <h3>Soil Erosion</h3>
            <p>Soil erosion is the denudation or wearing away of the upper layer of soil. It is a form of soil degradation. 
                This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of erosive agents, that is, water, ice (glaciers), snow, 
                air (wind), plants, and animals (including humans). In accordance with these agents, erosion is sometimes divided 
                into water erosion, glacial erosion, snow erosion, wind (aeolian) erosion, zoogenic erosion and anthropogenic erosion 
                such as tillage erosion. Soil erosion may be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur at 
                an alarming rate causing a serious loss of topsoil. The loss of soil from farmland may be reflected in reduced crop production 
                potential, lower surface water quality and damaged drainage networks. Soil erosion could also cause sinkholes.
                Intensive agriculture, deforestation, roads, acid rains, anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl 
                are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion.</p>

                <h3>Contour Farming</h3>
                <span>Preparing and cultivating on slopes can be challenging and can easily 
                    lead to soil erosion. However, contour farming technique, where farmers plant 
                    across a slope along the contour lines can salvage the situation.
                    This farming system serves to conserve rainwater and reduce soil loss from surface erosion.

                <h3>Avoiding Overgrazing</h3>
                <span>Grazing too many animals in the same place over a long period of time can contribute to a poor stand of 
                    vegetation. Vegetation in that condition leave soils exposed to the erosive force of water runoff.
                    You can significantly minimize these risks by employing proper pasture management practices and sustainable 
                    grazing. </span>

                <h3>Reforestation</h3>
                <span>Restoration of a degraded ecosystem and protection of the existing ones ensures 
                    sufficient soil erosion control. A recent study shows that a properly planted and maintained 
                    tree reduces erosion by 75 percent. </span>

                <h3>Agriculture</h3>
                <p>The farming practices are the major cause of soil erosion. 
                The agricultural activities disturb the ground. The trees are 
                cleared and the land is ploughed to sow new seeds. Since most of 
                the crops are grown during the spring season, the land lies fallow 
                during winters. Most of the soil is eroded during winters.
                Also, the tyres of tractors make grooves on the land, making a natural 
                pathway for water. Fine soil particles are eroded by wind.</p>

                <h3>Logging and Mining</h3>
                <p>A large number of trees are cut down to carry out the logging process. 
                    Trees hold the soil firmly. The canopy of the trees protects the soil 
                    from heavy rainfall. The leaf litter that protects the soil from erosion, 
                    is also lost during logging.
                    Mining activities also disturb the land and leave the soil more prone to erosion.</p>

                <h3>Construction</h3>
                <p>The construction of roads and buildings exposes the soil to erosion. The forests and grasslands 
                    are cleared for construction purposes, which exposes the soil making it vulnerable to erosion.</p>

                <data class="card-number" value="04">04</data>
                <h3>Rivers and Storms</h3>
                <p>The flowing rivers and streams carry away the soil particles leading to a V-shaped erosion activity.</p>

                <data class="card-number" value="05">05</data>
                <h3>Heavy Winds</h3>
                <p>During dry weather or in the semi-arid regions, the minute soil particles are carried away by 
                    the wind to faraway lands. This degrades the soil and results in desertification.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Grazing</h3>
                <p>The grazing animals feed on the grasses and remove the vegetation from the land. 
                    Their hooves churn up the soil. They also pull out plants by their roots. This 
                    loosens the soil and makes it more prone to erosion.</p>
